# Reversing wows .geometry 3D models

# Existing reversing & tools

I'm not the first on trying to reverse the geometry files.

This [Blender plugin](https://github.com/ShadowyBandit/.geometry-converter) was an early attempts from ShadowBandit, but with some [critical bugs apperently](https://github.com/ShadowyBandit/.geometry-converter/issues/3).
Never the less, the [implementation](https://github.com/ShadowyBandit/.geometry-converter/blob/main/io_mesh_geometry/import_geometry.py) could be tremendously helpful given how well the code is documented.
This reverse will probably steal quite a bit from this implementation and at least be crossed-referenced heavily.

On the proprietary side, this [third Party tool](https://gamemodels3d.com/forum/?topic=1348&page=1) also exists.
